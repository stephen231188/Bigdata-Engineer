Three main big data sources:
•	Machines
•	People
•	Origanization

How to get value from big data
Value come from integrating different types of data sources

Data intergation
1.	Reduce data complexity
2.	Increase data availability
3.	Unify your data system
   
Big data's characteristics
1.	Volume (Size)
2.	Varity (Complexity)
3.	Valence (Connectedness)
4.	Veracity (Quality)
5.	Velocity (Speed)
   
5 steps to process to gain value from big data
1.	Acquire
  •	Indentify data sets
  •	Retrieve data
  •	Query data
2.	Prepare Explore data
  •	Understand the nature of data
  •	Preliminary analysis Pre-process Data
  •	clean
  •	Integrate
  •	Package
3.	Analyze
  •	Select analytical techiques
  •	Build models
4.	Report
  •	Communicate results
5.	Act
  •	Apply results

The main elements of the Hadoop stack:

1.	Enable Scalability
2.	Handle Fault Tolerance
3.	Optimized for a Variety Data Types
4.	Facilitate a Shared Environnment
5.	Provide Value

7 Big Data Engineer skills will need:

A Big Data Engineer is required to be very skilled in many areas of expertise. Listed below are the top

Programming: Starting off, like most other technology-oriented job roles, out of all the Big Data Engineer skills, programming tops the list. A Big Data Engineer needs to have hands-on experience in any predominant programming language such as Java or Python.

Database and SQL: After programming comes the in-depth knowledge of DBMS and SQL. This will help in comprehending how data is managed and maintained in a database. You need to know how to write SQL queries for any Relational Database Management system. Some of the commonly used database management systems for Big Data engineering are MySQL, Oracle Database, and the Microsoft SQL Server.

ETL and Data warehousing: As mentioned earlier, one of the primary responsibilities of a Big Data Engineer is to carry out ETL operations. For this, you would need to know how to construct as well as use a data warehouse. 
As a Big Data Engineer, you will extract data from various sources, transforming them into meaningful information, and loading it into other data storages. Some of the tools used for this purpose are Talend, IBM Datastage, Pentaho, and Informatica.

Operating System: The fourth skill that you require is knowledge of operating systems. Operating tools are the base for running Big Data tools. Hence a strong understanding of Unix, Linux, Windows, and Solaris is mandatory.

Hadoop tools and frameworks: You must have experience with Hadoop based analytics. Hadoop is one of the most commonly used Big Data engineering tools, so it's understood that you need to have experience with Apache Hadoop based technologies like HDFS, MapReduce, Apache Pig, Hive & Apache HBase.

Apache Spark: The sixth skill that you require, is to have worked with real-time processing frameworks like Apache Spark. As a Big Data Engineer, you will be dealing with enormous volumes of data, so for this, you need an analytics engine like Spark, which can be used for both batch and real-time processing. Spark can process live streaming data from several sources like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and so on.
Data mining and modeling: The final skill requirement requires you to have experience with data mining, data wrangling, and data modeling techniques. Data mining and data wrangling include steps to preprocess and clean the data using various methods, find unseen trends and patterns in the data, and make it ready for analysis. 

Big Data Engineers examine massive pre-existing data to discover new insights through data modeling. Some of the tools used for this are Python, R, Rapid Miner, Weka, and KNIME. 

So, those were some of the skills required for you to become a Big Data Engineer. Going ahead, let’s have a look at the career prospects for a Big Data Engineer.
